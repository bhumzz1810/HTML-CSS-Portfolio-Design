                    <h3>Educational Background:</h3>
                    <p>I am currently pursuing a Post-Graduate Diploma in Web Development at Conestoga College, Doon
                        Campus. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from GTU. My studies
                        have provided me with a solid foundation in software engineering, web development, and systems
                        design, which I
                        continue to build upon with advanced web technologies in my current course.</p>

                    <h3>Place of Origin:</h3>
                    <p>I am originally from Ahmedabad, India, a vibrant place known for its rich culture and
                        diversity. Growing up
                        there has greatly influenced my creativity and problem-solving abilities, which I now apply to
                        my software
                        development work.</p>

                    <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy coding personal projects to learn new frameworks and languages, but I
                        also balance my
                        tech interests with creative outlets such as photography and painting. I love exploring digital
                        art, which helps
                        me bring unique aesthetics to my web designs.</p>

                    <h3>Activities:</h3>
                    <p>Outside of academics and work, I am an avid participant in hackathons and coding competitions,
                        which provide a
                        platform for teamwork and innovative thinking. I also enjoy traveling and experiencing different
                        cultures, which
                        broadens my perspective and allows me to approach software challenges in unique ways.</p>

                    <h3>Sports:</h3>
                    <p>To stay active, I regularly engage in sports like basketball and swimming. Additionally, I am
                        committed to maintaining
                        my fitness through consistent gym workouts. These activities not only help me maintain a healthy
                        lifestyle but also
                        teach me discipline, teamwork, and perseveranceâ€”qualities I bring to both my personal and
                        professional life.</p>
