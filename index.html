            <p class="introduction">Hi, I'm Bhumil. I am a dedicated and innovative <strong>Software Engineer</strong>
                with over 3 years
                of experience in developing scalable software
                solutions. My expertise spans across various programming languages, including JavaScript and PHP, as
                well as frameworks
                like React JS, Vue JS, Node JS, and Laravel. I have a strong background in designing and implementing
                RESTful APIs, data
                management, and systems integration, ensuring high performance and compliance with regulatory standards.

                requirements. I take
                pride in writing clean, efficient code that adheres to best practices and is maintainable for long-term
                success.
            </p>
            <p class="introduction">Throughout my career, I have successfully collaborated with cross-functional teams
                to deliver
